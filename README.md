# Parallax Effect Website ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **Parallax Scrolling Effect** where background and foreground images move at different speeds, creating an immersive 3D experience. The website is designed with multiple adventure sports sections, each showcasing a different parallax effect. 

## Features

- **Smooth Parallax Scrolling**: Uses layered images to create a depth effect with different scroll speeds for background and foreground.
- **Adventure Theme**: Includes sections like Biking, Para Gliding, and Surfing, making the experience more engaging.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes.
- **CSS Styling**: Utilizes advanced CSS properties like `translateZ`, `transform-style`, and `background-attachment` for the parallax effect.
  
## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## How It Works

The key concept behind the parallax effect in this project is the use of `translateZ` in combination with `perspective`. The background and foreground images are positioned at different distances from the viewpoint, creating the illusion of depth as you scroll.

- **Container**: Holds the content and ensures the layered images remain fixed while scrolling.
- **Perspective**: Set using CSS, it creates the depth of field required for the parallax effect.
- **Fixed Background**: The background images use `background-attachment: fixed` to stay in place while the content scrolls.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styles for the parallax effect and section designs.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditi-789/Parallex_Website.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Preview

Here's a quick preview of the website:
